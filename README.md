This Respitory was used for the Fall 2024 Freshamn Design Expo.  We placed first!  :D

--- Our project was a self serving coffee machine that was crontroled by and El_Potato and Arduino Uno. The person making coffee would use an LCD display that would be the main functioning tool.
    A gui was made to allow the person to choose the different types of creamers and sugars they would like as well as choose how much of that they would like. 
    You could also save how you like your coffee to a preset so that you could just click your name and your coffee would be made.
